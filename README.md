## I. Abstract (100)

The emerging technology of Augmented Reality (AR) in the past few decades has introduced many concepts for uses cases to assist a worker of any professional field to learn complex tools with little to no training at all in a fairly small amount of time.
 Now with many companies getting into the manufacturing of AR devices such as wearable glasses, these concepts could actually be brought to existence with applications that are created using a software development kit (SDK) such as ARToolKit. 
However, many of these AR devices are inaccessible to the common public because of cost and the small amount of developers that are creating these applications. 
In order to solve this problem, a prototype was created to make wearable AR devices accessible to everyone by taking a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. 
This prototype was created in order to give those without an education a way to learn DIY electronics and simple programming skills to create content for the AR devices.
This will provide an environment and a platform for the young generation to be a building block for the future of humanity.


## II. Narrative (500)

A plain cardboard box comes in your mail and it has a stamp with the words “Augmented Reality for Everyone!” on it. It has a simple tab that has an arrow on it instructing you to pull upward on the tab to open the top of the box. When you open it, a smaller box is revealed that contains a pair of dorky looking thick black rimmed glasses. The glasses have thick temples which look like they will be housing the electronics. The bridge is also thick and looks like it will house the camera. Examining the lenses of the glasses closer, you could tell that the lenses are thicker than normal and have some kind of reflecting material on it which is probably the OLED display. Outside of the smaller box contains numerous jump wires of different colors, transistors, resistors, capacitors, a small Li-Poly battery, a tiny camera, a tiny speaker, a touch sensor button, and one small blue chipboard that is known as an Arduino Nano.

A small instruction booklet is contained in it that has a picture of said dorky glasses on it with small electronics all over it. The book contains a few small warnings on it depicting some electrical hazards like all other new electronics contain. After a few pages of that, a small 11 page breakdown of the assembly of the AR glasses is presented. The booklet contains 13 pages total which is very lengthy but it gives you a completion time of 3-5 hours.

Once you pick up the thick glasses and follow the instruction booklet, you start connecting wires to the Nano and adding the transistors, resistors and capacitors. The booklet explains in detail exactly how each piece is important and what its functionality is to the glasses. The more difficult parts of the assembly process is when you have to open up the temple on the glasses and try to fit each piece into the housing. The LiPo has its own section, the speaker is right in front of it, the touch sensor is on the opposite side of the speaker and the nano fits perfectly right in the main body of the temple.

After properly fitting everything in and closing the housing, the instructions say to place the glasses on and hold the outside of the temple for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds you hear a distinct electronic tune that is modeled after the video game Portal. Then, a series of lots of code runs through the lenses which is the boot process for the Linux operating system that the glasses run on. After this, a command line pop-ups and displays the line “ar@everyone ~ $ _”. This is the beginning of the future for learning code easily by being able to see an augmented cheat sheet which will help you to learn code easily and not bother with paper cheat sheets. 


## III. Overview (500)
Answer the following questions in no more than 500 words total.

* What problem will this activity solve, or what opportunity will it exploit?

By having a heads up display (HUD) command line prompt projected in your line of sight by augmented reality (AR), you would solve the problem of having to deal with juggling paper cheat sheets and other physical interfaces. Being able to have a cheat sheet in an AR HUD for the most common commands of any programming or coding language available to you would give you an opportunity to be a proficient coder or programmer within days or weeks.

By having a heads up display with relevant information given to you in real time, having to remember dozens upon dozens of code would be a thing of the past. The days of needing to have a physical cheat sheet in front of you are gone.

* What is your project goal?

The goal for this project will be to provide an in-depth learning experience for those that have minimal to no experience in building prototypes with electronics and coding/programming for software development kits (SDK). This will give them an introduction to being able to understand emerging technology and new cutting edge hardware and SDKs.

By providing a DIY bootcamp platform for electronics and Augmented Reality, I hope to spark the interest of those with curiosity in the realm of new emerging technology and coding and programming. By setting a foundation for learning, my goal is to have pioneers in this realm of DIY to teach others in learning these concepts that they themselves have learned and mastered.


* What is your project objective?
  
The objective for this project is to make those with minimal knowledge of technology aware of new learning platforms that could give them an opportunity for a job or to teach others this knowledge and expand the learning horizon for the masses.

In order to bring all of the newly learned concepts together and create prototypes, I hope to prepare those that are learning these emerging technologies like AR to make sure they have a foundation to build, iterate and improve on the ideas that they have built


* What are your criteria for success?

In order to achieve success with this project, a certain number of criteria needs to be set. The order of this criteria is important and will be characterized by how well the individual that has this DIY kit is learning and interacting with the kit. The pace will be set by a learning curve and examined on how well the response is with the number of unknown concepts and subsequent absorption of the technology.

When the concepts are absorbed, learned and practiced, then the pace can be set and the techniques can be learned at a pace that is expected. When the AR HUD is introduced, this pace can be accelerated and assumed that within a certain timeline the individual will be coding and programming at a surprisingly fast level capable of speeds that are almost equal to those individuals that have a year or so of experience.


* What assumptions do you bring to this project?
  
  The assumption expected for this project will be that the individual will not be motivated enough to complete the DIY kit. Assembling AR glasses will be intimidating to many and only a few will be able to follow through in completing the assembly and coding of the content.
  
* What are the potential risks and obstacles?

 There are major risks to this project when it comes down to being able to provide the correct electronics for the kit. This includes choosing which board is the best for doing AR and also the size. The Arduino Nano is the most popular but not the smallest. Also, the OLED lens could be a challenge in making it display sharp images.

## IV. Content (1000)

An Augmented Realtiy (AR) Do-It-Yourself (DIY) kit is available to everyone that could affort $50 for this introduction to this emerging technology. What is offered is a platform for learning new technologies in the hardware and software realm and being able to rapidly implement those learned concepts into an integrated software development kit (SDK).

This emerging technology of AR is not a new concept. History of AR
The desire to supplement the skills of the human has been thought of and implemented over and over again in the past millennia. However, not a lot of technological advances has been made to make AR a learning platform for incremental progressions. 

When you have a tool to learn, you mostly reference a booklet or a multimedia experience like audio or video. There might be an interactive experience included with the audio and video learning part but it is mostly a physical platform with a few booklets and guides to online videos.

You can also have a physical interactive learning experience that includes having to ask an expert human being about AR and their experience with the platform and all of the common mistakes, successes and general assumptions about the new technology. Their stories and experiences with the technology can serve as inspirational platforms to learn from and also improve upon.

This immersive platform of augmented reality is still in its infancy and has yet to be proven successful within the educational realm. Of course when one thinks of AR, one immediately thinks of games and entertainment. There are plenty of application uses for these kind of platforms and it is no wonder why it is dominating the market.

With my idea of having AR available for everyone, this will hopefully encourage those that are interested and curious about this emerging technology to do research and learn as much as they can about it without being put off on how unknown or intimidating it might be.

There has been plenty of research in the realm of learning and AR within the last few decades spanning back to 1980 when it was used to teach pilots certain flight skills like landing a plane. These type of skills could only be learned by having a supplemental piece of hardware that allows for the learner to concentrate on the most important parts of their physical interaction with what they are doing and allows for them to visualize important parts of navigation without having to deal with other materials with their hands.

This same type of idea is the basis of what I would want to do with learning code and programming with a novice in mind that wants to be in technology. Being able to immerse oneself in an unknown technology and having the opportunity to learn hands on said technology is one of the most fulfillful experiences that one can have.

The world of AR will put the human psyche in a realm that it has never been before and will open up a platform of mystery of what human perception is and what it can be. Being able to see that which has never been seen before can be a whole new experience for many and might be too much for others. This is what technology has been and will continue to be. Many will not understand and will not be adopted. Google Glass tried and failed because of this reason.

If AR is to succeed then it has to be introduced to those that do not have as many opportunities as the privileged. If AR is to succeed then it needs to be shown to those that believe that technology is not as important than human abilities and human intuition. Technology has always been and will be on the forefront of human evolution.

Just like the lightbulb, the telephone, the automobile, the airplane, the radio, the television, the computer, the internet and countless other technological advances that humanity has made, Augmented Reality will be the next in the timeline for one of the technologies that humankind has been able to use to progress the evolution of humanity and develop a better understanding of human capability.

With that said, I have a dream that Augmented Reality can be provided to everyone with a Do-It-Yourself kit that encourages the common person without any knowledge of electronics or computing to be able to create their own AR glasses and code their own content so they might be able to offer a whole new perspective in the human realm and change the world that they live in.

This also introduces the whole new concept of perception. If you are able to view things that you were never had the chance to, what would that feel like? How would you feel like? How would you think? These are the questions that will be in the back of the minds of the subjects that will have AR glasses on. The concept of being able to have new information augmented into your field of vision is almost superhuman in a way.

If you wanted to know what the temperature was outside in a second, it would be in your periphery. More importantly, your heart rate and blood pressure can be displayed at a glance on command.. Your weight, height, blood type, race, ethnicity and any other medical records can be displayed to you before you see a doctor.

With these use cases, I would like to concentrate on the field of coding and programming for the field of AR. Those that will have the AR DIY kit will have the opportunity to build, create and code their own AR for whatever purpose that they imagine. If they want to know the codes for special moves for their favorite video game characters, they can program that into their AR glasses customized only for them. If they want to have cheat codes for a game that they cannot pass, they would be able too.

Augmented Reality is a special field that is still in its infancy and there are many applications and use cases that have yet to be researched but I believe that within the next five years that it will be on the forefront of the technological breakthrough that humanity has been waiting for.

## VI. Technology (100)

The hardware technology that will primarily be used is the Arduino Nano with the integrated ATmega328P microcontroller. This chipset is known for “autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed” [4] Because of it size, it complements the need for a small computer form factor in such a housing like glasses.

The other technology will be the software development and the content that will be created for the Nano. Using the Arduino IDE, I will code the foundation of the hardware and code other content using the SDK Vuforia. The software platform might change due to the hardware restrictions and also if it has the capabilities for the specific type of augmentation.
