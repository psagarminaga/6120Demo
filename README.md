## I. Abstract

What if there was a way to make life easier by augmenting simple step by step instructions for life? What if you were able to know exactly what to do and what to say at the right opportune moment? Would you trust a voice to tell you what to do when you are at a moment to do it? Would you say the exact thing that a voice tells you to say when it is necessary?

## II. Narrative

A description of the project as a user experience, expressed in no more than 500 words with a focus on providing the reader a clear view of the intended outcome of the project.

## III. Overview
Answer the following questions in no more than 500 words total.

* What problem will this activity solve, or what opportunity will it exploit?
* What is your project goal?
* What is your project objective?
* What are your criteria for success?
* What assumptions do you bring to this project?
* What are the potential risks and obstacles?

## IV. Content

A prosaic description of the content of the project, expressed in no more than 1000 words.

### V. Prior Art
Prior art is any evidence that your invention is already known. Prior art does not need to exist physically or be commercially available.

While looking for prior art, you should also look for competing art. These are ideas that may not be at all like yours but do the same job. It is important to study competing art for two reasons:

Most inventions are a solution to a problem, and most problems have more than one possible solution. You need to examine other solutions, as some may offer more advantages than yours.

## VI. Technology

A description of the hardware and software required to render the project to practice along with short and meaningful justifications of each technological component, with a brief introduction of no more than 250 words and a justification of each technology used expressed in no more than 100 words per technology.

## VII. Production Schedule

A timeline of production formatted using a Gantt chart that shows components and processes of production broken down appropriately into tasks and sub-tasks. A link to an online, hosted Gantt chart may be provided but the link must be verified as working for others to view before the submittal of the proposal.

## VIII. Budget

A line-item budget that details all costs associated with the project with the below format. You do not need to calculate accessories (cables, media) or tax or shipping and are afforded a single computer with Adobe Creative Suite (CS 5) to work on (so those items need not be accounted for).

|Item|Unit Cost|Qty|Cost|Justification|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Logitech 1995 Super low-tech camera|$99|3|$297|Computer vision; low frame rate and terrible resolution needed for the tracking LEDs on mice.|
