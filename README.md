## I. Abstract

The emerging technology of Augmented Reality (AR) in the past few decades has introduced many concepts for uses cases to assist a worker of any professional field to learn complex tools with little to no training at all in a fairly small amount of time.
 Now with many companies getting into the manufacturing of AR devices such as wearable glasses, these concepts could actually be brought to existence with applications that are created using a software development kit (SDK) such as ARToolKit. 
However, many of these AR devices are inaccessible to the common public because of cost and the small amount of developers that are creating these applications. 
In order to solve this problem, a prototype was created to make wearable AR devices accessible to everyone by taking a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. 
This prototype was created in order to give those without an education a way to learn DIY electronics and simple programming skills to create content for the AR devices.
This will provide an environment and a platform for the young generation to be a building block for the future of humanity.


## II. Narrative

A description of the project as a user experience, expressed in no more than 500 words with a focus on providing the reader a clear view of the intended outcome of the project.

## III. Overview
Answer the following questions in no more than 500 words total.

* What problem will this activity solve, or what opportunity will it exploit?
* What is your project goal?
* What is your project objective?
* What are your criteria for success?
* What assumptions do you bring to this project?
* What are the potential risks and obstacles?

## IV. Content

A prosaic description of the content of the project, expressed in no more than 1000 words.

### V. Prior Art
Prior art is any evidence that your invention is already known. Prior art does not need to exist physically or be commercially available.

While looking for prior art, you should also look for competing art. These are ideas that may not be at all like yours but do the same job. It is important to study competing art for two reasons:

Most inventions are a solution to a problem, and most problems have more than one possible solution. You need to examine other solutions, as some may offer more advantages than yours.

## VI. Technology

A description of the hardware and software required to render the project to practice along with short and meaningful justifications of each technological component, with a brief introduction of no more than 250 words and a justification of each technology used expressed in no more than 100 words per technology.

## VII. Production Schedule

A timeline of production formatted using a Gantt chart that shows components and processes of production broken down appropriately into tasks and sub-tasks. A link to an online, hosted Gantt chart may be provided but the link must be verified as working for others to view before the submittal of the proposal.

## VIII. Budget

A line-item budget that details all costs associated with the project with the below format. You do not need to calculate accessories (cables, media) or tax or shipping and are afforded a single computer with Adobe Creative Suite (CS 5) to work on (so those items need not be accounted for).

|Item|Unit Cost|Qty|Cost|Justification|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Logitech 1995 Super low-tech camera|$99|3|$297|Computer vision; low frame rate and terrible resolution needed for the tracking LEDs on mice.|
