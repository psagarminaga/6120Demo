## I. Abstract (100)

The emerging technology of Augmented Reality (AR) in the past few decades has introduced many concepts for uses cases to assist a worker of any professional field to learn complex tools with little to no training at all in a fairly small amount of time.
 Now with many companies getting into the manufacturing of AR devices such as wearable glasses, these concepts could actually be brought to existence with applications that are created using a software development kit (SDK) such as ARToolKit. 
However, many of these AR devices are inaccessible to the common public because of cost and the small amount of developers that are creating these applications. 
In order to solve this problem, a prototype was created to make wearable AR devices accessible to everyone by taking a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. 
This prototype was created in order to give those without an education a way to learn DIY electronics and simple programming skills to create content for the AR devices.
This will provide an environment and a platform for the young generation to be a building block for the future of humanity.


## II. Narrative (500)

A plain cardboard box comes in your mail and it has a stamp with the words “Augmented Reality for Everyone!” on it. It has a simple tab that has an arrow on it instructing you to pull upward on the tab to open the top of the box. When you open it, a smaller box is revealed that contains a pair of dorky looking thick black rimmed glasses. The glasses have thick temples which look like they will be housing the electronics. The bridge is also thick and looks like it will house the camera. Examining the lenses of the glasses closer, you could tell that the lenses are thicker than normal and have some kind of reflecting material on it which is probably the OLED display. Outside of the smaller box contains numerous jump wires of different colors, transistors, resistors, capacitors, a small Li-Poly battery, a tiny camera, a tiny speaker, a touch sensor button, and one small blue chipboard that is known as an Arduino Nano.

A small instruction booklet is contained in it that has a picture of said dorky glasses on it with small electronics all over it. The book contains a few small warnings on it depicting some electrical hazards like all other new electronics contain. After a few pages of that, a small 11 page breakdown of the assembly of the AR glasses is presented. The booklet contains 13 pages total which is very lengthy but it gives you a completion time of 3-5 hours.

Once you pick up the thick glasses and follow the instruction booklet, you start connecting wires to the Nano and adding the transistors, resistors and capacitors. The booklet explains in detail exactly how each piece is important and what its functionality is to the glasses. The more difficult parts of the assembly process is when you have to open up the temple on the glasses and try to fit each piece into the housing. The LiPo has its own section, the speaker is right in front of it, the touch sensor is on the opposite side of the speaker and the nano fits perfectly right in the main body of the temple.

After properly fitting everything in and closing the housing, the instructions say to place the glasses on and hold the outside of the temple for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds you hear a distinct electronic tune that is modeled after the video game Portal. Then, a series of lots of code runs through the lenses which is the boot process for the Linux operating system that the glasses run on. After this, a command line pop-ups and displays the line “ar@everyone ~ $ _”. This is the beginning of the future for learning code easily by being able to see an augmented cheat sheet which will help you to learn code easily and not bother with paper cheat sheets. 


## III. Overview (500)
Answer the following questions in no more than 500 words total.

* What problem will this activity solve, or what opportunity will it exploit?

By having a heads up display (HUD) command line prompt projected in your line of sight by augmented reality (AR), you would solve the problem of having to deal with juggling paper cheat sheets and other monitor displays. As a coder or programmer, being able to have a cheat sheet in an AR HUD for the most common commands of any programming or coding language available to you would give you an opportunity to be a proficient coder or programmer within days or weeks.

By having a heads up display with relevant information given to you in real time, having to remember dozens upon dozens of code would be a thing of the past. The days of needing to have a white board, another monitor or paper that gives you the list of commands for the language that you are programming are gone.


* What is your project goal?

The goal for this project will be to provide an in-depth learning experience for those that have minimal to no experience in building prototypes with electronics and coding/programming for augmented reality. This will give them an introduction to being able to understand emerging technology and new cutting edge hardware and software development kits (SDK).

By providing a DIY bootcamp platform for electronics and Augmented Reality, I hope to spark the interest of those with curiosity in the realm of new emerging technology and coding and programming. By setting a foundation for learning, my goal is to have pioneers in this realm of DIY to teach others in learning these concepts that they themselves have learned and mastered.


* What is your project objective?
  
  The objective for this project is to make those with minimal knowledge of technology aware of new learning platforms that could give them an opportunity for a job or to teach others this knowledge and expand the learning horizon for the masses.

In order to bring all of the newly learned concepts together and create prototypes, I hope to make sure that those that are learning these emerging technologies like AR to make sure they have a foundation to build, iterate and improve on the ideas that they have built.

  
* What are your criteria for success?

  In order to achieve success with this project, a certain number of criteria needs to be set. The order of this criteria is important and will be characterized by how well the individual that has this DIY kit is learning and interacting with the kit. The pace will be set by a learning curve and examined on how well the response is with the number of unknown concepts and subsequent absorption of the technology.

When the concepts are absorbed, learned and practiced, then the pace can be set and the techniques can be learned at a pace that is expected. When the AR HUD is introduced, this pace can be accelerated and assumed that within a certain timeline the individual will be coding and programming at a surprisingly fast level capable of speeds that are almost equal to those individuals that have a year or so of experience.

* What assumptions do you bring to this project?
  That the common person would want to motivate themselves to do-it-themselves for a technology that is emerging.
* What are the potential risks and obstacles?
  Not having the right electronics to create the DIY kit and the common person not having the motivation to create something.

## IV. Content (1000)

A prosaic description of the content of the project, expressed in no more than 1000 words.

### V. Prior Art
Prior art is any evidence that your invention is already known. Prior art does not need to exist physically or be commercially available.

While looking for prior art, you should also look for competing art. These are ideas that may not be at all like yours but do the same job. It is important to study competing art for two reasons:

Most inventions are a solution to a problem, and most problems have more than one possible solution. You need to examine other solutions, as some may offer more advantages than yours.

## VI. Technology (100)

A description of the hardware and software required to render the project to practice along with short and meaningful justifications of each technological component, with a brief introduction of no more than 250 words and a justification of each technology used expressed in no more than 100 words per technology.

## VII. Production Schedule

A timeline of production formatted using a Gantt chart that shows components and processes of production broken down appropriately into tasks and sub-tasks. A link to an online, hosted Gantt chart may be provided but the link must be verified as working for others to view before the submittal of the proposal.

## VIII. Budget

A line-item budget that details all costs associated with the project with the below format. You do not need to calculate accessories (cables, media) or tax or shipping and are afforded a single computer with Adobe Creative Suite (CS 5) to work on (so those items need not be accounted for).

|Item|Unit Cost|Qty|Cost|Justification|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Logitech 1995 Super low-tech camera|$99|3|$297|Computer vision; low frame rate and terrible resolution needed for the tracking LEDs on mice.|
